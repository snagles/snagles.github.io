      <description>&lt;p&gt;Say that three times fast. At some point or another every engineer has encountered the same phenomenon. Two situations that were diametrically opposed; delivery slowed to a crawl while the team was being pushed for more and more. If you were lucky, you were being asked for estimates&amp;hellip; if you were unlucky, you were being told the deadline. The combination of problems that led you there were varied and could not be traced to a single person or decision, but the outcome still felt predetermined. Saddled with disappointment you attempted to trudge on, but as the necessary changes were harder and harder to make, the cost/benefit trade offs that you weighed with every decision made your brain spiral out of control. Every move you made felt like the wrong one and you knew that with each compromise you were just  making it worse. In the moment it may not have been easy to recognize it. I only just now learned there is a term for it. Jim Collins apparently even wrote a book on it: the doom loop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
