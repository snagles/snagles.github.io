    <p>Say that three times fast. At some point or another every engineer has encountered the same phenomenon. Two situations that were diametrically opposed; Delivery slowed to a crawl while the team was being pushed for more and more. If you were lucky, you were being asked for estimates&hellip; if you were unlucky, you were being told the deadline. The combination of problems that led you there were varied and could not be traced to a single person or decision, but the outcome still felt predetermined. Saddled with disappointment you attempted to trudge on, but as the necessary changes were harder and harder to make, the cost/benefit trade offs that you weighed with every decision made your brain spiral out of control. Every move you made felt like the wrong one and you knew that with each compromise you were just  making it worse. In the moment it may not have been easy to recognize it. I only just now learned there is a term for it. Jim Collins apparently even wrote a book on it: the doom loop.</p>
<h1 id="doom-loop">Doom Loop</h1>
<p>Like mine, your doom loop started with one initial negative condition, which created a second, which begat a third, and continued on in a negative reinforcement spiral further reinforcing the previous ones. Doom loops don’t often come as a surprise, they don’t sneak up on you, there are many warning signs as you are pulled further and further in. You closed your eyes to a problem here, tried and failed to limit something&rsquo;s impact over there, made compromises everywhere, and as those actions made the pull stronger, you felt it. You knew you were approaching something, you just didn’t know when the gravity of it all would be too strong to resist, hell, you didn’t even notice how hard you were resisting. With more funding you hoped you could add new team members to fix all of the issues you were asked to blind yourself to, you hoped that with roadmap clarity you could be ruthless in how you prioritized your time, you hoped that with an investment in tooling you could get some of that time back, and you hoped that if you could just drop support for those features that were impossible to maintain (and you knew no one used) that it would be enough. But there you were, you were in it.</p>
<p>Back in the “real” world, the ramifications of a doom loop are clear, it can take years to break the cycle. From climate change to the financial crisis there’s plenty of examples to point to. Doom loops always end eventually, it is just a question of when and where they bottom out, and if you will survive the fallout. You hoped in that moment that the time had come, but like me, you became impatient – waiting was not enough. When and how your spiral would end was anyone&rsquo;s guess, but you weren’t trying to solve climate change, you had options, right? Right. You could have done nothing, you could have pushed harder, you could have ignored it like many others did, you could have dug in forcing others to act, or you could have just walked away. For a sane person the choice would have been easy, but maybe, like me, you are not a sane person. You’re all in until you’re not, and you were all in. If you weren’t helping, you were hurting. You needed to do something to change the loop&rsquo;s direction.</p>
<h1 id="flywheel">Flywheel</h1>
<p>Well what do you know, there is a term for the inverse of doom loop – a flywheel. One initial positive condition creates a second, which begins a third, and continues on in a positive reinforcement spiral further reinforcing the previous ones. All you needed to do was get the flywheel rotating and with time and continued effort things would turn around. Easy, right? Right. You, like me, put together a plan.</p>
<p>The plan attempted to get the team out from under the crushing technical debt. You built internal agreement defining what quality meant and were understanding during the struggle to reach it. You segmented the problematic areas to limit impact on the rest of the product and led by taking on much of the “shoveling” yourself. You pushed for clear ownership at all levels of the organization and exemplified ownership in everything you did.</p>
<p>The plan tried to identify and hire the right contributors who would make real impacts on the organization. You worked to optimize the hiring process by reorganizing the inefficient parts and making them efficient. You set out to be transparent with candidates and ensured their interests and skill sets were aligned with an environment such as yours. You defined expectations for their role and had a clear, pre-defined plan for their integration.</p>
<p>The plan strived to onboard new external and internal contributors to maximize their impact. You made sure newcomers weren’t isolated with low impact tasks while the rest of the team continued on. You prioritized knowledge sharing and collaboration with the hows and whys so that everyone was equipped to make more informed decisions themselves. You built an environment receptive to new ideas and perspectives and encouraged feedback. You empowered everyone to remove the pain points they would inevitably encounter in your neglected pipelines and processes.</p>
<p>The plan made an effort to build empowered and cross-functional focused teams. The teams were structured to orient collaboration around what skill sets the projects required. You limited the scope of focus to minimize context switches. You treated the product organization as an integral part of the team and evolved the processes and procedures to reflect that. Close collaboration looked to create an avenue for shared context so informed design and development decisions could be made without having to wait for an answer from up the chain. You standardized the team&rsquo;s objectives, responsibilities, and worked to define agreed upon norms. You created a level playing field by being an advocate for balancing engineering and product priorities that often were out of balance.</p>
<p>Your plan sought to communicate a clear vision on what you all were doing, why you all were doing it, and how you all were going to get there. You pushed for defining team missions that all work undertaken can be pointed back to. You pressured leadership to share more context for decisions and how they were reached.</p>
<p>With enough time and deliberate effort you knew the plan would reverse the doom loop and get momentum flowing in the right direction again, it would become a flywheel. But did yours?</p>
<h1 id="outcome">Outcome</h1>
<p>Flywheel or doom loop, for better or worse, naive or enlightened, I have always cared about the organization I am a part of. If you were lucky enough to be surrounded by truly good people like I was, caring about their success required care for the organization&rsquo;s as well. The success of one directly depended on the success of the other. As much as I would like to say my doom loop has turned around thanks to the right intentions, the right people, the right plan, and the right processes, I can’t. Delivering software isn’t something special, it is just like everything else, there is nuance, there is risk. No one achieves anything alone. Sometimes the organizational inertia is too much to overcome, sometimes you’re not in a position to affect meaningful change, sometimes exhaustion takes over. Oftentimes the outcome is completely out of our control. While deliberate thought, planning, communication, and empowerment are all objectively good things, it is just a piece of a larger game of probability. The best we can do is stack the odds in our favor and give ourselves the best likelihood of success. Sometimes we lose. That doesn’t mean the game isn’t worth playing. Until the next round.</p>
